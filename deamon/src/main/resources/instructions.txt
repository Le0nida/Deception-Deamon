To build and run the Docker container within which the REST API server will execute, execute the following commands in the directory containing the Dockerfile and the generated server .zip:

- docker build -t your_project_image .
- docker run -p 8080:8080 your_project_image

These commands will build the Docker image and start a container based on it.
The server will be available at http://localhost:8080 once the container is running.

NOTE: If you are running deamon, client and MySQL server with docker on your machine, use the following command in order to connect your REST API server with the rest of the network:

- docker run -p 8080:8080 -it --network deamon_app-network your_project_image

"deamon_app-network" is the default network name present in the docker-compose.yml file used to run all other services.

To build and run the Docker container within which the REST API server will execute, execute the following commands in the directory containing the Dockerfile and the generated server .zip:

- docker build -t your_project_image .
- docker run -p 8080:8080 your_project_image

These commands will build the Docker image and start a container based on it.
The server will be available at http://localhost:8080 once the container is running.
